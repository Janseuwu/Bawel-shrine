    <h2>BAWEL AND HIS BELOVED TANKS</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">As mentioned, Bawel is a BIG fan of tanks. I had him give me some of his favorites along with a rating from 1 - 10.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        <b>Bob Semple</b> <br>
        His all time favorite tank is the "Bob Semple". 
        It sure is an interesting looking vehicle, which definitely is one of the reasons he loves it so much. A couple of pictures of it can be seen below: <br> 
        <img src="pictures/bobsemple.jfif" alt="Bob Semple tank" class="tanks"> <img src="pictures/Bob_Semple_Tank side.jpg" alt="Bob Semple tank" class="tanks"> <br>
        As i mentioned before, he LOVES memes, which probably is the biggest reason as to why he loves this tank so much. This tank is apparently a huge meme of a tank
        due to the lack of ability to do ANYTHING properly. As he said himself - "It's fucking shit at everything, but the people from Australia and New Zealand loved it". <br>
        Bawel gives this tank a 10/10
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        <b>Challenger 3</b> <br>
        Another one of Bawel's beloved tanks is the "Challenger 3": <br>
        <img src="pictures/challenger 3.jfif" alt="Challenger 3" style="width: auto; height: 190px;"> <img src="pictures/challenger 3(1).jfif" alt="Challenger 3" style="width: auto; height: 190px;"> <br>
        The Challenger 3 is a british tank, which he also is a big fan of. He mainly likes it because of the looks and not so much because of the functionality,
        as he straight up said "It's kinda shit but kinda hot". <br>
        Bawel gives this tank an 8/10
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        <b>T72 Moderna</b> <br>
        And again, he really likes this tank, but mostly for the looks. He loves how it has a big gun and then a little smaller one. In some cases it even has two extra guns!
        And once again, he said that it sucked.
        I'm starting to notice a theme here. He's mainly attracted to the stupidity of the tanks or the looks. Well anyway, here's a picture of it: <br>
